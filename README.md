# Clean-and-analyse-employee-exit-surveys

This project was used to help me test my data cleaning skills. I viewed the data and tried preparing for analysis to answer a question. I corrected the 2 datasets and standardised most of the columns by either renaming them or changing their values to match in both datasets, whilst dropping columns that weren't needed in the analysis. Created new columns to aid in the analysis and used vectorised string methods to handle missing values. Towards the end I concatenated the two datasets and aggregated the data to answer the initial question.
